# MyReads Project
This is a Reactjs project for Udacity's FE Nanodegree program. It is an app that allows you to search for books and organize them under three possible categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read.  The external modules react-router-dom and prop-types were also used.

## To Run
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
