# MyReads Project
This is a practice project for Udacity's FE Nanodegree program.  It is an app that allows you to search for books and organize then under three possible categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read.

## To Run
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.  The search terms are CASE SENSITIVE.
