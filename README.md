# MyReads Project
This is a Reactjs project for Udacity's FE Nanodegree program. It is an app that allows you to search for books and organize them under three possible categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read.  The external modules react-router-dom and prop-types were also used.

## To Run
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.  The search terms are CASE SENSITIVE.
